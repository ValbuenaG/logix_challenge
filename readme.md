# Logixboard Frontend Engineering Take-Home Challenge

## Setup

### Dependencies

This app was built with Node.js 15, but it should work with most modern versions of Node.js. If
you run into any hiccups start by making sure you're on Node 15. We encourage the use of a tool
like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage multiple versions and
make sure you're running the correct one.

To install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To start the development server:
```
npm start
```

Once started, the development server should show any typescript errors and should auto-reload on
any code change. The app is by default exposed on `http://localhost:3000` which you can visit in
the browser of your choice.
